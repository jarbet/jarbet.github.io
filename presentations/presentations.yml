  path: https://jarbet.github.io/presentation-pvalue-histograms/
  description: >
    p-value histograms are a diagnostic tool that can be used answer 2 important questions:
    1) Is there evidence of a signal in your study? and 2) are there any
    problems with your analysis?

  path: https://jarbet.github.io/presentation-mars.github.io/presentation-mars.html
  description: >
    Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a nonparametric machine learning method
    that automatically identifies which features are important for predicting the target variable (feature selection)
    as well as what forms the features should take (feature engineering), *i.e.* whether a feature should have
    a linear, non-linear, additive, or interaction effect. It is fairly fast method for working with big data
    and produces an interpretable model (not a black box).

  description: >
    Many machine learning models are considered "black boxes": data is input and predictions are output, but we have little insight into how the model makes its decisions.
    This presentation covers methods for interpreting models, including visualizing the relationships between predictors and outcome, variable importance scores,
    interaction scores to identify predictors that interact, and methods to explain how a model makes a prediction for a given subject (LIME and Shapley values).

  description: >
    Multi-omics data integration is the process of combining data from different omics platforms (*e.g.* genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of biological systems.
    This presentation explains how to download multi-omics data from the TCGA database.
    Then dimension reduction methods are considered (PCA, PLS and CCA), and are shown to identify groups of correlated features.
    Lastly, two machine learning methods are compared for using multi-omic features to predict survival in kidney cancer patients.

- title: Robust regression for noisy biological data
  path: https://jarbet.github.io/presentation-ordinal-regression/ordinal_regression.html
  description: >
    Biological variables are often non-normally distributed, contain outliers, may have lower limits of detection, excessive zeros or multiple modes.
    The proportional odds (PO) regression model can easily handle these issues and is a robust alternative to linear regression and other parametric models.
    Indeed, the PO model can be thought of as an extension of the robust Wilcoxon rank-sum test that can adjust for covariates.

  path: 20220422_triplet_matching.pdf
  description: >
    Propensity score matching is a popular method for attempting causal inference with observational data.
    However, the vast majority of implementations focus on matching only two groups for a binary exposure variable.
    This presentation introduces triplet matching, a generalization of propensity score matching to three groups.

  path: ./2025-05-08_batch_effects_nowhite.pdf
  description: >
    Batch effects are systematic non-biological differences between groups of samples that can confound the results of an experiment.
    This presentation explains how to identify batch effects in high-dimensional data, and how to account for them in your analyses.
