Welcome to my blog *Possibly Significant*.  This is place for me to test out new statistical ideas, share short R stats tutorials, and organize notes. This is not meant to be highly polished material, but is more a place for me to quickly organize my thoughts on various stats topics, share new ideas and short R scripts for common statistical analyses.  Perhaps you will find something significant here.
